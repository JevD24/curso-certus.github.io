        Argentina (Spanish pronunciation: [aɾxenˈtina] (audio speaker iconlisten)), officially <b>the Argentine Republic[A]</b> (Spanish: República Argentina), <i>is a country in the southern half of South America.</i> <u>Argentina covers an area of 2,780,400 km2</u> (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] making it the largest Spanish-speaking nation in the world by area. It is the second-largest country in South America after Brazil, the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. It shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over a part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

        The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.[16] The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times. The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century.[17] Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata,[18] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards, radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; over 60% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry,[19][20][21] and Argentine culture has significant connections to Italian culture.
